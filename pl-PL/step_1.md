## Copy parts between sprite costumes

Click on the **Costumes** tab for your sprite:

![Available costumes for the Nano sprite](images/nano-costumes.png)

**Tip:** Duplicate the costume you want to edit - so you can still use the original if needed. Right-click (or tap and hold on a tablet) on the costume and choose 'duplicate'. You will now have a second copy of the costume.

![Location of the duplicated costume](images/nano-a2-costume.png)

To remove any areas of the costume you no longer need, click on the part to select it then click **Delete**.

The duplicated costume with parts removed should look something like this:

![Nano with arm deleted](images/nano-arm-deleted.png)

**Tip:** If you make a mistake in the Paint editor you can click Undo ![image of the undo icon](images/nano-undo.png)

Go to the costume with the detail you want to add and click on the part you need then click **Copy**.

If you want to add a costume not already shown in the **Costumes** tab, click on the **Choose a costume** button. Then find the costume you want and click on it to add it to your sprite.

Go back to the duplicated costume and click on **Paste**. The duplicated costume should look something like this:

![Nano a2 with new arm](images/nano-a2-new-arm.png)

Now switch to the **Code** tab you will be able to use your new costume in your code blocks:

```blocks3
switch costume to [nano-a2 v] // the edited costume
```
