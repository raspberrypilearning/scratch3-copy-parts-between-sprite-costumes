## Copy parts between sprite costumes

Click on the **Costumes** tab for your sprite:

![Available costumes for the Nano sprite](images/nano-costumes.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Tip:** Duplicate the costume you want to edit, right-click (or tap and hold on a tablet) on the costume and choose 'duplicate'. You will now have a second copy of the costume - so you can still use the original if needed.

To remove any areas of the costume you no longer need, click on the part to select it then click **Delete**.

The duplicated costume with parts removed should look something like this:

Go to the costume with the detail you want to add and click on the part you need then click **Copy**.

If you want to add a costume not already shown in the **Costumes** tab, click on the **Choose a costume** button. Then find the costume you want and click on it to add it to your sprite.
